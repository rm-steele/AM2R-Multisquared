# AM2R Multisquared

A mod that combines Mutiworld and Multitroid into a single mod, so you can adventure with your friends!

This is designed aroung each player using their own slot, having every player on the same slot is untested, but would probably work.

Use F3 to connect to Multiworld (after entering your slot info for the first time, it gets saved between sessions!), then use F1 to connect to the Multitroid server. You must connect in that order!
